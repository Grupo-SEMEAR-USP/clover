# ‚ôüÔ∏è NRA Fork ‚ôüÔ∏è

This Clover Fork has the purpose of enabling our quadcopters at NRA to use the Clover package as a high level framework. This framework basically enables some easy to use services and functionalities at a higher level than MavROS and PX4 vanilla. 

Our branch system works as follows: 
- `harpia-2023` (2023): formerly `CloverJetsonCBR23` renamed to better fit the purpose: adapt clover to harpia. Used in CBR 2023 for the first time.  
- `Swarm in Blocks` (2023): Following work for Copterhack 2023. 4th place! [CLICK HERE ](https://clover.coex.tech/en/swarm_in_blocks_2.html#table-of-contents)
- `Swarm in Blocks` (2022): First Swarm in Blocks project for Copterhack 2022. Winners (1st place)! [CLICK HERE](https://clover.coex.tech/en/swarm_in_blocks.html)

Be aware that the Master branch is synced with the original Clover repo, therefore, it's not a good choice to use it, but it should be kept in-sync with the original repo. 
Feel free to create more branches! 

## VIO

One hot topic in NRA history is the Visual Odometry. The `harpia-2023` is the one that fits the `t265_px4_NRA_bridge` with our VIO.

# cloverüçÄ: create autonomous drones easily

<img src="docs/assets/clover42-main-margin.png" align="right" width="400px" alt="COEX Clover Drone">

Clover is an open source [ROS](https://www.ros.org)-based framework, providing user-friendly tools to control [PX4](https://px4.io)-powered drones. Clover is available as a ROS package, but is shipped mainly as a preconfigured image for Raspberry Pi. Once you've installed Raspberry Pi on your drone and flashed the image to its microSD card, taking the drone up in the air is a matter of minutes.

COEX Clover Drone is an educational programmable drone kit, suited perfectly for running clover software. The kit is shipped unassembled and includes Pixracer-compatible autopilot running PX4 firmware, Raspberry Pi 4 as a companion computer, a camera for computer vision navigation as well as additional sensors and peripheral devices. Batteries included.

The main documentation is available at [https://clover.coex.tech](https://clover.coex.tech/). Official website: [coex.tech/clover](https://coex.tech/clover).
